INTRODUCTION                              *pave*

Pave provides a set of high-level commands to interact with Perforce
from within vim. It is not a 1:1 replacement for functionality provided by
the command-line Perforce client (use vim's ability to invoke external 
programs via `!` for that) or the Perforce visual client (use P4V itself for
that).

Instead, Pave tries to address more user-level tasks, such as freeing
the user from having to worry about whether `p4 add` or `p4 edit` is the right
operation for the current file, or quickly pulling up a diff for the current
file.

COMMANDS                                  *pave-commands* 

Pave provides the following commands:

:PaveOpen                                 *pave-:PaveOpen*
                                          Open the current file for add or
                                          edit, as appropriate.

:PaveRevert                               *pave-:PaveRevert*
                                          Reverts changes to the current file.

:PaveDiff                                 *pave-:PaveDiff*
                                          Opens a diff split between the head
                                          revision of the current file (on the
                                          left) and the local copy of the file
                                          (on the right).
